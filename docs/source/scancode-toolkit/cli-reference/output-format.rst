Scancode Output Formats
=======================

Scan results generated by Scancode are available in different formats, to be specified by the
following options.

.. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/output_format_options.rst

.. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/note_snippets/output_samples.rst

---

``--json FILE``
---------------

    Among the Scancode Output Formats, ``json`` is the most important one, and is recommended over
    others. Scancode Workbench and other applications that use Scancode Result data as input accept
    only the ``json`` format.

    .. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/note_snippets/output_json_notdef.rst

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``json`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --json output.json samples

    The entire JSON file is structured in the following manner:

    At first some general information on the scan, what options were used, nnumber of files etc.
    And then all the files follow.

            },
        }

    .. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/note_snippets/output_json_ugly.rst

----

``--json-pp FILE``
------------------

    ``json-pp`` stands for JSON Pretty-Print format. In the previous format, i.e. simple ``json``, the
    whole output is printed in one line, which isn't well suited for getting information if you're
    looking at the file itself (or printing at stdout). So this option formats the output results in
    json but in a properly spaced and indented manner, and is easy to look at.

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``json-pp`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --json-pp output.json samples

    Here's a sample JSON output for one file ::

        {
          "path": "samples/JGroups/licenses/apache-1.1.txt",
          "type": "file",
          "name": "apache-1.1.txt",
          "base_name": "apache-1.1",
          "extension": ".txt",
          "date": "2019-09-18",
          "size": 2937,
          "sha1": "186d9195787fcbf2e5401b966159395640e06d11",
          "md5": "8c909d7735f28f4fdb0128ee57fb430e",
          "files_count": null,
          "mime_type": "text/plain",
          "file_type": "ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators",
          "programming_language": null,
          "copyrights": [
            {
              "statements": [
                "Copyright (c) 2000 The Apache Software Foundation."
              ],
              "holders": [
                "The Apache Software Foundation."
              ],
              "authors": [],
              "start_line": 4,
              "end_line": 5
            }
          ],
          "packages": []
        },

----

``--json-lines FILE``
---------------------

    Scancode also has a ``jsonlines`` format option, where each report of a file scanned is formatted
    in one line.

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``json-lines`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --json-lines output.json samples

    Here is a sample line from a report generated by the ``jsonlines`` format::

        {"files":[{"path":"samples/zlib/ada",licenses":[],"copyrights":[],"packages":[]}]}

    The header information is also formatted in one line (i.e. The first Line of the file).

    .. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/note_snippets/output_jsonlines.rst

----

``--spdx-rdf FILE``
-------------------

    `SPDX <https://spdx.org/>`_ stands for "Software Package and Data Exchange" and is an open standard
    for communicating software bill of material information (including components, licenses,
    copyrights, and security referances).

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``spdx-rdf`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --spdx-rdf output.spdx samples

    Learn more about SPDX specifications `here <https://spdx.org/specifications>`_ and in this GitHub
    `repository <https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec>`_.

    Here the file is structured as a dictionary of named properties and classes using W3C's
    `RDF Technology <https://www.w3.org/RDF/>`_.

----

``--spdx-tv FILE``
------------------

    This format is another SPDX variant, with the output file being structured in the following manner:

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``spdx-tv`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --spdx-tv output.spdx samples

    A SPDX-TV file starts with::

    After a section titled ``#Packages``, a list follows.

    .. image:: data/output_spdx_tv_package.png

    Each File information is listed under a ``#File`` title, for each of the files.

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 3

        - FileName
        - FileChecksum
        - LicenseConcluded
        - LicenseInfoInFile
        - FileCopyrightText

    An example goes as follows:

    .. image:: data/output_spdx_tv_file.png

    After the files section, there's a section for licences under a ``#Licences`` title, with the
    following information for each licence:

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 3

        - LicenseID
        - LicenseComment
        - ExtractedText

    Here's an example:

    .. image:: data/output_spdx_tv_licenses.png

----

.. _output_html:

``--html FILE``
---------------

    Scancode supports formatting the Output result is a simple ``html`` format, to open with your
    favourite browser. This helps quick visualization of the detected licence/copyright and other main
    information in the form of tables.

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    HTML format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --html output.html samples

    The HTML page generated has these following Tables:

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 2

        - Copyright and Licenses Information
        - File Information
        - Package Information
        - Licenses (Links to Dejacode/License Homepage)

    .. image:: data/output_html1.png

    .. image:: data/output_html2.png

    .. image:: data/output_html3.png

----

``--html-app FILE``
-------------------

    Scancode also supports formatting the output in a HTML visualization tool, which is more
    helpful than the standard HTML format.

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``html-app`` format::

        ./scancode -clpieu --csv output.html samples

    The Files scanned are shown in the left sidebar, and the section on the right contains seperate
    tabs for the following:

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 2

        - License Summary
        - Copyright Summary
        - Clues
        - File Details
        - Packages

    .. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/note_snippets/output_htmlapp_search.rst

    .. include::  /scancode-toolkit/rst_snippets/warning_snippets/output_htmlapp_dep.rst

    .. image:: data/output_html_app1.png

    .. image:: data/output_html_app2.png

    .. image:: data/output_html_app3.png

----

``--csv FILE``
--------------

    Scancode can publish results in the useful ``.csv`` format.

    The following code performs a scan on the samples directory, and publishes the results in
    ``csv`` format::

        ./scancode -lpceiu --csv sample.csv samples

    The first line of the csv file contains the headings, and they are:

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 3

        - Resource,
        - type,
        - name,
        - base_name,
        - extension,
        - date,
        - size,
        - sha1,
        - md5,
        - files_count,
        - mime_type,
        - file_type,
        - programming_language,
        - is_binary,
        - is_text,
        - is_archive,
        - is_media,
        - is_source,
        - is_script,
        - scan_errors,
        - license__key,
        - license__score,
        - license__short_name,
        - license__category,
        - license__owner,
        - license__homepage_url,
        - license__text_url,
        - license__reference_url,
        - license__spdx_license_key,
        - license__spdx_url,
        - matched_rule__identifier,
        - matched_rule__license_choice,
        - matched_rule__licenses,
        - copyright,
        - copyright_holder,
        - author,
        - email,
        - start_line,
        - end_line,
        - url,
        - package__type,
        - package__name,
        - package__version,
        - package__primary_language,
        - package__summary,
        - package__description,
        - package__size,
        - package__release_date,
        - package__homepage_url,
        - package__notes,
        - package__bug_tracking_url,
        - package__vcs_repository,
        - package__copyright_top_level

    Each subsequent line represents one element, i.e. can be any of the follwoing:

    .. hlist::
        :columns: 5

        - license
        - copyright
        - package
        - email
        - url

    So if there's multiple elements in a file, they are each given an entry with the details mentioned
    earlier.
