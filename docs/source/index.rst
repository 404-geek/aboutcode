AboutCode Documentation
=======================

.. admonition:: ToDo
   :class: custom-admonition-todo

   We need a short intro that ties together everything we cover in this RTD and describes in general terms the connection between this RTD and the informal (i.e., not a legal entity) ``AboutCode.org`` (https://www.aboutcode.org), which is applying as ``AboutCode.org`` to participate in `GSoD 2020 <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>`_.

Welcome to the AboutCode documentation!
